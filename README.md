# E-Commerce-Data-Management-and-Insights

An end-to-end e-commerce website was developed to manage various components such as customer details, products, orders, suppliers, payments, and advertisements. These components were identified as distinct entities and represented through an Entity-Relationship (E-R) diagram (E-R Diagram.jpg).

Based on this diagram, a fully normalized database schema was designed up to the Third Normal Form (3NF) to ensure data integrity and eliminate redundancy. The database was implemented using SQL, and an ETL pipeline was developed to ingest synthetic data efficiently.

To ensure data accuracy and consistency, data quality checks were performed using R, followed by in-depth analysis through data visualizations, providing valuable insights into the systemâ€™s performance.

A comprehensive project report has been included, outlining each step of the process in detail : E-Commerce Database Design.pdf
