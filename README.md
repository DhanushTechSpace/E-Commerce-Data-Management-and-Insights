# E-Commerce-Data-Management-and-Insights

Starting with an E-R Diagram (E-R Diagram.jpg), a fully normalized schema up to the third normal form (3NF) was developed. SQL was used to create a database an ETL pipeline was built to ingest synthetic data into the database. Data quality was checked using R programming language, and the data was analyzed through various visualizations.
